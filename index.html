                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>My name is Oana and my story started <a href="https://www.maternitatea.ro/ro/" target="_blank">here</a>
                    on 24 Oct 1986, when I was born with 4,40 kilos and 59 centimeters.
                    <br>Big baby, I know! Swaddling me was a complicated task :)).</p>

                <h2>Childhood</h2>
                <p> I cannot tell you too many things about me as a child. Just that I was crazy for sweets. My parents
                    remember that, when they were picking me up from the kindergarden, I used to run to a cakeshop
                    which was in our way home and quickly order a cake and sit down to a table so that they could not
                    tell me no :)). And that, like most of you, I had the famous haircut that made me look more like a
                    boy than a girl.</p>

            <h2>Growing up</h2>
            <p> Growing up, I've always liked math better than literature, maybe because when I was in the
                elementery school my mom "tortured" me in weekends by doing math problems. </p>
            <p>Because I was always organized and detail-oriented, it felt like a natural choice to go to Economic
                High School and then to study Finance and Banks at Transilvania Univerity.</p>
            <p>Right after finnishing the studies, I started working in Bancpost. I worked there for 3 years and
                then I moved to Banca Transilvania, where I've worked for another 3 years. I've learned many things
                but what made me unhappy was the tremendous pressure which was not justified. Although I am
                grateful for what I've learned, when I'd left I was like <audio controls>
                    <source src="yeyyy.mp3"> </audio></p>
            <p>Nowadays, I work in a totally diferent domain and I am happier.</p>

                <h2>Evolving</h2>
                <p>Out of curiosity and desire to do something more meaningful workwise and encouraged by a friend, I
                    decided to take the class "Intro in IT" from <a href="https://scoalainformala.ro/program/intro-in-it-brasov/"
                        target="_blank"> Scoala informala de IT.</a> It was a great choice! In addition to the new
                    knowledge, I've met wonderful people with whom I've shared joyful moments and panic attacks:)). </p>
